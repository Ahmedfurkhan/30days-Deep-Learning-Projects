# Introduction to Data Science & Deep Learning

## Overview

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistical analysis, data engineering, machine learning, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It involves the use of various techniques, algorithms, and tools to analyze, visualize, and interpret data, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning, is a powerful approach that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data. It has revolutionized fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance in many tasks.

This README provides a comprehensive introduction to Data Science and Deep Learning, covering key concepts, tools, and methodologies.
